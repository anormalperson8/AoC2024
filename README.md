## AoC 2024

This is the repository for my attempt at [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

Will I finish all 25 puzzles? From previous years' experience, probably not. Even if I do, definitely not in time.

The main language used is Python.

The code will probably be very spaghetti and low in quality, so referring to this as a solution is a bad idea.
